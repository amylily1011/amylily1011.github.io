👋 Hi, I’m Amy!

UX explorer by day, dumpling enthusiast by night 🥟✨

I’m a London-based UX Design Manager with a soft spot for elegant systems, bold ideas, and anything that makes complex things feel delightfully simple. I’ve spent the last 10+ years designing products and experiences that live at the intersection of cloud infrastructure, AI, and open source — making the technical feel human.

My favorite things include:
-	✨ Turning user pain points into aha! moments
-	🧠 Nerding out on systems thinking, accessibility, and the psychology behind great design
-	🔍 Asking “Why?” one too many times during meetings
-	🧪 Prototyping ideas before caffeine kicks in

When I’m not designing, you might find me:
- Competing in CTF security challenges (yes, for fun - who does that?)
- Making dumplings and creating new recipes 🍜
- Planning my next big adventure (Shanghai & Chongqing recently stole my heart)

I believe great design happens when we listen deeply, explore curiously, and build fearlessly — always keeping the people we serve at the center.

Let’s build something beautiful, weird, and meaningful together.
